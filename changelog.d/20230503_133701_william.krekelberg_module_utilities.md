### Changed

- Moved `modesl, data, idealgas` from `thermoextrap.core` to `thermoextrap`.
  These were imported at top level anyway. This fixes issues with doing things
  like `from thermoextrap.data import ...`, etc.
- Moved `core._docstrings_` to `docstrings`.
- Now using `cmomy.docstrings` instead of repeating them here.
